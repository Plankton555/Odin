=================================================
Changes from BWAPI 4.0.0 Beta to BWAPI 4.0.1 Beta
=================================================
Changes:
  * All interface pointers are now hidden. Instead of Unit* you will now just use Unit. This will require a "Replace in Files" operation to convert existing sources.
  * The installer now prompts the user to locate the Starcraft installation directory if it is not found.
  * Game::setTextSize now takes a BWAPI::Text::Size::Enum parameter instead of an integer.
  * All instances of IsUnpowered were renamed to IsPowered.
  * The AI module in the configuration now accepts absolute paths (Ex: C:/stuff).

Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed a regression that prevented auto-menu from functioning.
  * Fixed an issue that caused Type::getType to be case sensitive.
  * Fixed a regression where addons and the engineering bay returned incorrect tile sizes.
  * Fixed a regression that prevented the construction of structures on the right and bottom edges of the map.
  * Fixed a regression that prevented the example projects from building out-of-the-box.
  * Fixed a bug where auto_menu caused a second multi-instance client to redownload a map that already existed.
  * Fixed a bug where auto_menu attempted to start a game before map downloads could be processed.
  * Fixed a regression that prevented the client/server setup from communicating.

============================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.7.4 to BWAPI 4.0.0 Beta
============================================
General Changes:
  * All BWAPI projects have been upgraded to use Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.
  * BWAPI now uses the available C++11 features, such as move semantics, std::function, lambdas, and nullptr.
  * The location of BWAPI.dll has been moved to the bwapi-data folder.
  * Several performance improvements have been made for BWAPI.
  * The save_replay configuration option has been altered for more flexibility on date/time stamps.
  * The documentation has been extensively reworked and is now included as offline HTML files. Not all documentation has been updated but will continue to be worked on.
  * A proper installer is now distributed for BWAPI.

Necessary Regressions:
  * BWAPI no longer supports loading older revisions of itself.
  * The holiday lights have been removed.
  * BWTA is no longer compatible with BWAPI.

AI/Tournament Module:
  * Type data is no longer initialized by the module, and can now be retrieved properly at any time.
  * The gameInit function is now exported to initialize the Broodwar pointer.
  * The original newAIModule function now takes 0 arguments.
  * Removed the Tournament enum restartGame.

Sets and Vectors:
  * Using a custom new class template known as a Vectorset, BWAPI and AI modules can perform significantly better (faster and less memory). This replaces the use of STL containers, but is used the same way (with Vectorset::iterator, stl algorithms, etc).
  * It can be treated like a vector or a set, and the user has the option of treating it as a vector for some cases and a set for others.
  * Additional convenience members have been added, such as .rand(), which returns the value of a random element of the set.

Positions:
  * Position, TilePosition?, and the new WalkPosition? now all share the same class template: Point. This maintains consistency between member functions to be used by any Position type, and provides conversions between each type, including custom ones.
  * Positions now have several operators that make arithmetic easier. For example, Position(8,8)/2 will give Position(4,4) and Position(30,20) - Position(15,5) will give Position(15,15).
  * There is also Position::set, derived from the Vectorset that will handle sets of Positions.
  * The x and y members are now public, and the x() and y() member functions have been removed.
  * Added the constants Positions::Origin, TilePositions?::Origin, etc. which represent (0,0).

Interface:
  * Each interface class will have its own derived set with several enhancements, and brings in some functionality similar to that of BWSAL. The new sets are as follows: Unitset, Playerset, Regionset, Bulletset, Forceset
  * Interface overhead has been reduced by making some member functions with alternative parameters non-virtual. Keep in mind some function parameters have been re-arranged so that default parameters can be used.
  * getClientInfo/setClientInfo are now available to all Interface classes, and also take an optional parameter that acts as a key.
  * User-defined events have been added, and can be utilized through registerEvent.

Types:
  * Types have also received their own set, the Type::set (Example: UnitType::set).
  * The behavior of type creation has been changed, and now all types with an id between 0 and Unknown will be considered valid, even if data for the type has not been defined in BWAPI. This drastically simplifies the type's constructors.
  * Most type data is now made constant and no longer requires an initialization to be made. This gives users more flexibility for when they want to access type information.
  * Added a Type::isValid function.
  * All types' enumerations are now available (for switch case usage) and are accessed by Types::Enum (Example: UnitTypes::Enum::Terran_Marine).
  * TechType::energyUsed has been renamed to energyCost.
  * All types now overload std::ostream operator<< (including Color).
  * UnitTypes::getUnit, Races::getRace, etc. have now been replaced with static Type::getType. (Example: Races::getRace doesn't exist, use Race::getType)
  * Added UnitType::width, UnitType::height, and UnitType::isCritter.

Game:
  * Draw functions now take Position parameters as an alternative to individual x and y.
  * The parameters for canBuildHere, canMake, canResearch, and canUpgrade have been rearranged.
  * getUnits_ functions now return a Unitset copy instead of a reference, and also now takes a function predicate.
  * Added getClosestUnit, getBestUnit, getClosestUnitInRectangle, vPrintf, vSendText, vSendTextEx, vDrawText, isGUIEnabled, getBuildLocation, getDamageFrom, and getDamageTo.
  * Removed getScreenBuffer, setReplayVision(use setVision for replays too), changeRace, and startGame.
  * Instead of using Game::printf, you may use BWAPI::Broodwar like you would std::cout, using operator <<.
  * Using Special_Start_Location? in canBuildHere will ignore units that are occupying the space while still checking for resource distance.
  * Some functions now take an Enum type instead of an int.

Unit Filters:
  * UnitFilter is a new powerful function composition object and function predicate for use with getUnits_ functions throughout the interface. It can generally be combined with any other functional object (including lambdas) using operators && and ||, as well as ! for the inverse. (Example: !(IsFlyer || IsLifted) )
  * CompareFilter is a sister function composition object that compares the values returned from the call to the object, and can be combined using operators ==, <, <=, >, >=, and !=. (Example: GetType == UnitTypes::Terran_SCV && HP_Percent < 100)
  * Filters can be found in the BWAPI::Filter namespace.

Player:
  * groundWeaponMaxRange and airWeaponMaxRange have been removed. Use weaponMaxRange instead.
  * getTextColor now returns a char instead of an int so that it is printed correctly when used with ostream operator <<.
  * Added damage(WeaponType)
  * Unit count functions now take a default parameter of AllUnits.
  * Rename groundWeaponDamageCooldown to weaponDamageCooldown.

Unit:
  * The parameters for build have been rearranged.
  * getUnits_ functions now return a Unitset copy instead of a reference, and also now takes a function predicate.
  * Added getClosestUnit, getUnitsInRadius, getSpaceRemaining, and isTargetable.
  * Removed getUpgradeLevel.
  * Several functions for testing command validity were added.
  * Unit commands are now more strict.
  * getResources now returns the last-known resource amount when the unit becomes inaccessible.

Region:
  * Added a getUnits function.
  * Renamed isWalkable to isAccessible

Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed a bug where Unit::getRemainingBuildTime failed to work correctly for some units (such as siege tanks).
  * Fixed a bug where Spider Mines were not correctly identified for Jim Raynor (Vulture).
  * Fixed a bug where key enum values were incorrectly mapped for Game::getKeyState.
  * Fixed a bug that allowed multiple instances of the BWAPI DLL to be injected into Broodwar, which could cause compatibility issues.

=======================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.7.3 to BWAPI 3.7.4

  * Fixed a bug where drawText with a string over 255 characters could cause an overflow.
  * Fixed a bug involving some uninitialized game data causing an inconsistency during the first game.
  * Fixed an issue where shared memory would require high level permissions such as administrator. The permission requirement should now be reduced.

=======================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.7.1 to BWAPI 3.7.2
=======================================
Changes:
  * The exception filter now informs of NULL Broodwar pointers when the game crashes, making it more informative.
  * The exception filter now destroys the direct draw window (if the game crashes in full screen) to make debugging easier.

=====================================
Changes:
  * Complete map information is now available when the game ends, so that bots may view post-game information.
  * The single unload unit command now optimizes a select only when the command optimizer level is at least level 2 (prevents mistakes generated by replay analyzers).
  * If the game is minimized in single player with windowed mode enabled, it will now automatically increase the speed of the gameplay.

  * Fixed an issue where the Zerg's Spore Colony and Sunken Colony unit types did not contain the correct requirements.
  * BWAPI should no longer crash when the Starcraft version is incorrect. Instead it will display a message box and attempt to remain functional.
  * Partially restored WINE compatibility through a workaround that disables BWAPI's Server functionality using the new config option shared_memory. 

=====================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.6 to BWAPI 3.6.1

  * Command optimizer level 4 will now group Archon Warp and Dark Archon Meld. 

Additions:
  * Added Orders::NukePaint.
  * Added TechType::getOrder.
  * Position and TilePosition can now be treated as a boolean value and will automatically call isValid(). This is an effort to make cleaner-looking code. 

Bug Fixes:

  * Fixed various minor potential buffer overflows/underflows.
  * Correctly initialize some Player values.
  * Fixed a bug where non-existent players' Start Locations were excluded from the Start Location group in a Use Map Settings (revealing only opponent Start Locations).
  * Fixed a regression where Archon Warp and Dark Archon Meld always returned an error. 

=====================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.5.4 to BWAPI 3.6
=====================================

Changes:
  * Starcraft now always uses the saved speed setting in Single Player instead of using Normal speed. This means that Single Player games will always start on fastest if that was your last setting in multi-player.
  * Some tileset-reserved palette entries were removed.
  * The constructor for Color(r,g,b) has been optimized for speed.
  * Players that are observing, as well as Start Locations for possible Observer players are excluded from the list of enemies and start locations.
  * The Unload Unit command now uses less actions by performing the command with no matching select unit.
  * Several [TechType#targetsUnit TechType::targetsUnit] and [TechType#targetsPosition TechType::targetsPosition] flags have been altered to be consistent with the tech's capabilities.
  * Logging and the logging_str config option in BWAPI have been removed. Attach the debugger instead.

Additions:
  * Added [Game#hasPath Game::hasPath].
  * Added [Misc#Position Position::hasPath].
  * Added configuration option "pause_dbg" which pauses the auto-menu until you attach a debugger (only in DEBUG mode).
  * Added [Misc#TilePosition TilePosition::hasPath].
  * Added [Game#setAlliance Game::setAlliance].
  * Added [Game#setVision Game::setVision].
  * Added more options and variants to [Game#hasPower Game::hasPower].
  * Added a new function [Game#hasPowerPrecise Game::hasPowerPrecise] which takes a pixel coordinate instead of a tile position.
  * Added some Use Map Settings [UnitTypes] that were missing, such as [UnitTypes#Special_Map_Revealer Map Revealer], [UnitTypes#Special_Start_Location Start Location], [UnitTypes#Doors Doors], and [UnitTypes#Traps Traps].
  * Added a new config entry called {{{mapiteration}}} which allows you to specify if wildcard maps will be chosen randomly or in a sequence.
  * Added [Unit#getOrderTarget Unit::getOrderTarget].
  * Added [Game#observers Game::observers] which returns the list of observing players in a Use Map Settings.
  * Added [Player#isObserver Player::isObserver].
  * Added the auto_menu config options {{{wait_for_min_players}}}, {{{wait_for_max_players}}}, and {{{wait_for_time}}} which change the way BWAPI behaves when hosting a network game.
  * BWAPI now supports a tournament module to control the flow of tournaments.
  * Added [Game#elapsedTime Game::elapsedTime].
  * Added [Game#setCommandOptimizationLevel Game::setCommandOptimizationLevel] which allows BWAPI to automatically optimize commands to lower APM.

Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed a bug in [Unit#isInWeaponRange Unit::isInWeaponRange] where the minimum range of 0 would be included in the computation.
  * Fixed an issue where BWAPI and its loaders did not attempt to first find the Starcraft install path in HKEY_CURRENT_USER and instead only looked in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
  * Fixed a bug where the bot's APM counter did not reset between matches.
  * Fixed an issue where BWAPI's Windowed Mode (set in config) would initially start the application in Fullscreen before switching back.
  * Increased compatibility with other hacks, depending on their behaviour.
  * Fixed an issue where [Game#hasPower Game::hasPower] could return incorrect results.
  * Fixed some cases where bad calls could cause a buffer overflow.
  * Fixed an issue where users without administrative privileges were unable to use BWAPI. Limited users will now be able to use BWAPI and an AI DLL, but will not be able to use the Client/Server setup.
  * Fixed an issue where [TechTypes#Healing Healing](for HealMove) and [TechTypes#Maelstrom Maelstrom] could not be used in [Unit#useTechPosition Unit::useTechPosition].
  * Fixed a bug/regression where [Game#mapFileName Game::mapFileName] would return with the full path after using auto-menu.
  * Fixed a bug/regression where Battle.net Recent Maps would save a map with its path attached after using auto-menu.
  * Fixed an issue where auto_menu did not start multi-player games on its own.
  * Fixed a bug where a unit position returned an incorrect value when it was intended to be Unknown.
  * Fixed a bug where a unit's clientInfo was not reset to NULL in a new game.

=======================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.5.3 to BWAPI 3.5.4
=======================================

Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed a crash on game end involving extended ascii characters in the map name.
    * Fixed an auto-menu issue/regression where the map's registered path was assumed to be in the maps\BroodWar folder
    * Fixed an issue where restartGame switched to a different map in auto-menu mode.
    * Fixed a crash involving a rare occurance that causes a unit's hit box to be partially outside of the playable map area.
    * Fixed an issue where text sent by the player near the end of the match (specifically when BWAPI was defeated) would be carried over to the next game. 

=======================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.5.2 to BWAPI 3.5.3
=======================================

Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed an issue/regression where auto-menu would spawn or hide units in replays depending on the selected auto-menu game type.

=======================================
Changes from BWAPI 3.5.1 to BWAPI 3.5.2
=======================================

Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed an issue/regression where auto-menu failed to work for replays. 

==========================================
Changes from BWAPI Beta 3.5 to BWAPI 3.5.1
==========================================

Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed an issue where screenshots were disabled while in Windowed mode.
    * Fixed a bug/regression that caused replays to crash.

========================================
Changes from BWAPI Beta 3.4 to BWAPI 3.5
========================================

Changes:

    * The return values for Game::getGroundHeight have been altered. This allows the inclusion of doodads in terrain height computation (For example: Units behind a tree).
    * The DEBUG version now checks for memory leaks.
    * Game::isBuildable now includes a boolean to specify whether to check if a visible building is blocking the way. It is false by default.
    * Game::canBuildHere has slightly increased performance.
    * Game::drawLine has greatly increased performance.
    * The config values "ai_dll" and "ai_dll_dbg" have been replaced with "ai" and "ai_dbg", the revision and multi-instance entries ("ai_dll_rev", "ai_dll_#", etc.) have been removed. More information in the updated bwapi.ini config file.
    * Some distance functions now use integers instead of doubles.
    * The config option "save_replay" under "auto_menu" now accepts environment variables as well as our user defined variables. It also creates the directory if it does not exist, and creates the file directly instead of copying LastReplay.rep (LastReplay.rep will not be created).
    * Most BWAPILIB objects now have an "operator int() const" as a replacement for all other comparison operators. This allows more flexibility, specifically for the developers of BWAPI, so that a call to ".getID()" does not need to be made.
    * Resizing the window in Windowed Mode will now stretch the game screen.
    * Holding ALT in Windowed Mode will now prevent the cursor from leaving the window (same as W-Mode functionality).
    * The auto-menu map selection no longer loops back and forth with the previous menu in order to select the correct map.
    * The map entry under auto_menu in the config now accepts wildcards, and chooses a random map from the pool when starting the game.
    * BWAPI's custom network module has been marked deprecated and replaced by BWDI's module. (SNP file)
    * Unit::attackMove and Unit::attackUnit have been renamed to Unit::attack to conform with the other functions. Current users can perform a Find&Replace in all files(a function provided by Visual Studio and Notepad++), or use a #define.
    * Ordering an Infested Terran to Attack a location (Attack Move) will now cause it to explode at that location. (Also known as "Sap Location")
    * Renamed UpgradeType::mineralPriceBase to UpgradeType::mineralPriceBase, UpgradeType::gasPriceBase to UpgradeType::gasPrice, and UpgradeType::upgradeTimeBase to UpgradeType::upgradeTime, as well as added the parameter that specifies the level. These functions now include the cost factors in calculations. To obtain the base value, use 1 as the parameter.
    * There is a new menu hack that causes menus to load immediately instead of the old one which quickly played the swish-in and swish-out animations.
    * BWAPI's windowed mode can now be resized smaller than the game's resolution. The window will snap to the original dimensions when they are close enough.
    * Holding the CTRL key while resizing the windowed mode window will now maintain a 4:3 aspect ratio. 

Additions:

    * Added Game::getAPM which retrieves the bot's running actions per minute and ignores user actions.
    * Added the errors Errors::File_Not_Found and Errors::Invalid_Parameter.
    * Added Game::setMap which changes the map for when you next restart the game.
    * Added Unit::isUnderAttack which identifies units that have been recently attacked.
    * Added Unit::getLastAttackingPlayer which identifies the player that last attacked this unit.
    * Added Game::getUnitsInRectangle.
    * Added Game::getUnitsInRadius.
    * Added Unit::getUnitsInRadius.
    * Added Unit::getUnitsInWeaponRange.
    * Added the configuration option "holiday" which allows disabling the once-secret holiday modifications that were activated at the appropriate time.
    * Added Game::setFrameSkip which alters Starcraft's built-in frame skipping value.
    * Added some more UnitTypes that are specific to Use Map Settings games, as well as the WeaponTypes to go with them.
    * Added a new configuration option "screenshots" under "Starcraft" which allows you to specify the format Starcraft saves screenshots in. Defaults to "GIF".
    * Added UnitType::isMineralField which just returns true if the unit is Mineral Field Type 1, 2, and 3. BWAPI currently converts all Mineral Fields to Type 1 for its own purpose, so you don't need to worry too much about it.
    * Added Unit::isUnderDarkSwarm.
    * Added Unit::isUnderDisruptionWeb.
    * Added UpgradeType::whatsRequired, which returns the building required to accompany the upgrade at a certain level.
    * Added Player::weaponMaxRange which takes a WeaponType instead of a UnitType.
    * Added several configuration options for BWAPI's windowed mode.
    * Added the ability to queue commands like you can in Starcraft. Many command constructors have this addition built-in. Re-read the documentation on them for more information.
    * Added UnitCommand::isQueued. 

Bug Fixes:

    * Corrected the return values for Game::getLatencyFrames, Game::getLatencyTime, Game::getRemainingLatencyFrames, and Game::getRemainingLatencyTime.
    * Fixed a crash involving the use of the extended ASCII character set in the drawText functions.
    * Fixed a memory leak that was unique to Starcraft: Broodwar.
    * Corrected WeaponTypes::normalWeaponTypes and WeaponTypes::specialWeaponTypes which were returning the wrong sets.
    * Fixed a bug where Game::canBuildHere would fail in some cases where buildings can overlap. See  issue 302  for more information.
    * Fixed a bug that would cause the game to freeze for several seconds when invalid positions were passed to Game::drawLineMap.
    * Fixed a bug that prevented the usage of known /commands on a Battle.net server.
    * Fixed an issue where Overmind With Shell, Overmind, Cerebrate, Cerebrate Daggoth, and Overmind Cocoon would return false for isDetector(). They now correctly return true.
    * Fixed a bug in Windowed Mode where the System Cursor was displayed instead of the game cursor.
    * Game::restartGame no longer freezes/crashes the game when called during multi-player. Instead it silently returns an error.
    * Fixed an infinite loop involving auto-menu attempting to find the correct map.
    * The new network mode now displays lobby slots correctly.
    * Fixed a bug where Player::getKillScore returned the unit score instead of the kill score.
    * Fixed an issue where ordering a Protoss Photon Cannon, Terran Missile Turret, Zerg Sunken Colony, or Zerg Spore Colony to attack would perform no action.
    * Fixed a bug where Game::canUpgrade returned false positives when a required building was not present.
    * Fixed an issue where some bullet types such as the Subterranean Spines were inaccessible with CompleteMapInformation disabled.
    * Fixed an issue where area abilities such as EMP Shockwave could not be used on a unit target (Use_Tech_Unit).
    * Fixed a bug where two or more instances could conflict and crash when saving LastReplay. 

=============================================
Changes from BWAPI Beta 3.3 to BWAPI Beta 3.4
=============================================

Changes:

    * Position::getApproxDistance now returns an integer and more accurately resembles the internal Starcraft function.
    * Player::allUnitCount now returns the number of accessible units of the given type for the given player. If complete map information is disabled, this will be equivalent to Player::visibleUnitCount.
    * Player::getUpgradeLevel now also returns information for enemy players when the Complete Map Information flag is disabled if at least one completed unit owned by that player that uses that upgrade type is accessible.
    * There has been a regression involving the optimization of issuing commands to multiple units at the same time (Stop, Hold, Cloak/Decloak, Burrow/Unburrow, Siege/Unsiege). This will not impact the behaviour of the game or the AI. It will however increase the APM of the AI.
    * Renamed Unit::getLastOrderFrame to Unit::getLastCommandFrame to make it consistent with Unit::getLastCommand, Unit::issueCommand, and Unit::canIssueCommand. 

Additions:

    * Added Unit::isInWeaponRange which returns true if the specified target unit is in the immediate weapon range of the callee.
    * Added Player::visibleUnitCount which returns the number of visible units of the given type owned by the player.
    * Added Game::neutral - returns a pointer to the neutral player.
    * Added Game::allies - returns a reference to the set of ally players that have not left or been defeated.
    * Added Game::enemies - returns a reference to the set of enemy players that have not left or been defeated.
    * BWAPI will attempt to compare its revision/build with the AI revision/build and load the correct BWAPI module for the AI. Note: For the moment this only applies when attaching BWAPI to Starcraft and not when the module is loaded.
    * Added the following Player functions to retrieve player score: Player::getUnitScore, Player::getKillScore, Player::getBuildingScore, Player::getRazingScore, Player::getCustomScore.

    * Added UnitTypes::allMacroTypes for the introduced macros.
    * Added Unit::placeCOP which allows you to relocate Flag Beacons in Use Map Settings or Capture the Flag game types.
    * Added Unit::isAttackFrame - returns true if the unit is performing an attack animation or starting an attack.
    * Added the LPIP network mode known as "Local PC (Pipes)". This mode is compatible with Windows XP and previous revisions of BWAPI. However it has the same issue as the other custom network mode. Instructions are the same, copy the SNP file to the Starcraft directory.
    * Added Unit::getAcidSporeCount.
    * Added Unit::isInvincible.
    * Added Unit::getLastCommand - returns the last successful command that BWAPI issued to the unit.

    * Added UnitCommand::getTargetPosition - returns the target position of the command, or Positions::None if there is no target position.
    * Added UnitCommand::getTargetTilePosition - returns the target tile position of the command, or Positions::None if there is no target tile position.
    * Added UnitCommand::getUnitType - returns the unit type of the command, or UnitTypes::None if the command is not of type Build, Build_Addon?, Train, or Morph.
    * Added UnitCommand::getTechType - returns the tech type of the command, or TechTypes::None if the command is not of type Research, Use_Tech?, Use_Tech_Position?, or Use_Tech_Unit?.
    * Added UnitCommand::getUpgradeType - returns the upgrade type of the command, or UpgradeTypes::None if the command is not of type Upgrade.
    * Added UnitCommand::getSlot - returns the slot of the command, or -1 if the command is not of type Cancel_Train_Slot?.
    * Applied a hack that now looks for files relative to the Starcraft directory first before checking the MPQ. Modifications to Starcraft can now be done without the need for MPQ management.

=============================================
Changes from BWAPI Beta 2.4 to BWAPI Beta 2.5
=============================================

    * Added a logging option to bwapi.ini - by default it is set to off.
    * Added TechType::getRace (the function was declared before but not actually implemented).

    * Fixed a bug where Game::canBuildHere would return true even when a nexus/command center/hatchery was too close to invisible minerals/geysers. The function now uses static mineral and geyser data and assumes mineral fields exist unless it can see the build tile where the mineral is supposed to be, and cannot see the mineral unit.
    * Fixed a bug where Unit::isIdle would return false after a worker failed to start construction of a building.
    * Fixed a bug where using Siege Tanks would cause the game to crash.

    * Fixed a bug where Unit::setRallyPosition and Unit::setRallyUnit would not execute properly.
    * Fixed a bug where Unit::patrol would appear to change the position of the unit to the target position.
    * Fixed a bug where Unit::isStartingAttack would always be false for certain types of units, even when they were attacking.
    * Fixed a bug where scanner sweep (and possibly other tech types that don't need to be researched) would not work.
    * Fixed a bug where AIModule::onFrame would be called twice on the first frame.
    * Fixed a bug where Unit::train would not allow more than one unit to be added to the training queue.
    * Fixed a bug where AIModule::onUnitDestroy would not be called for units loaded into dropships/shuttles/overlords when the transport unit was destroyed.
    * Fixed UnitType::topSpeed, Unit::getVelocityX, and Unit::getVelocityY. Everything should now be in pixels per frame.

Changes from BWAPI Beta 2 to BWAPI Beta 2.1
=============================================

  * Fixed a bug that produced phantom marines. An internal unit set in BWAPI
    was not being reset between matches, so units that existed in a previous
    match appeared to exist in the next game as phantom marines. Retrieving
