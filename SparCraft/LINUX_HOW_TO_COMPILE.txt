SparCraft for linux uses a stripped-down version of BWAPI called bwdata, located in SparCraft/linux/bwdata
Do not attempt to use this with any other version of BWAPI libraries under linux because it's not tested and not necessary

You need the following packages installed:

OpenGL Libraries
- opengl (freeglut worked)

SDL Libraries
- libsdl
- libsdl-gfx
- libsdl-image

To compile: (from SparCraft root)

g++ -O3 source/*.cpp bwapidata/include/*.cpp source/glfont/*.cc -Ibwapidata/include -Isource/glfont -o SparCraft `sdl-config --cflags --libs` -lGL -lGLU -lSDL_image

run with:

./SparCraft sample_experiment/sample_exp_linux.txt
