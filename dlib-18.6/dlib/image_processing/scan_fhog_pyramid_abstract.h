            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for running a fixed sized sliding window classifier
                over an image pyramid.  In particular,  it slides a linear classifier over
                a HOG pyramid as discussed in the paper:  
                    Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection by Navneet Dalal
                    and Bill Triggs, CVPR 2005
                However, we augment the method slightly to use the version of HOG features 
                from: 
                    Object Detection with Discriminatively Trained Part Based Models by
                    P. Felzenszwalb, R. Girshick, D. McAllester, D. Ramanan
                    IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 32, No. 9, Sep. 2010
                Since these HOG features have been shown to give superior performance. 

            THREAD SAFETY
                Concurrent access to an instance of this object is not safe and should be
                protected by a mutex lock except for the case where you are copying the
                configuration (via copy_configuration()) of a scan_fhog_pyramid object to
                many other threads.  In this case, it is safe to copy the configuration of
                a shared object so long as no other operations are performed on it.

                  a width to height ratio approximately equal to window_width/window_height
                  and will be approximately window_width*window_height pixels in area or
                  larger.  Therefore, the smallest object that can be detected is roughly

                - Since we use a HOG feature representation, the detection procedure works
                  as follows:
                    Step 1. Make an image pyramid.
                    Step 2. Convert each layer of the image pyramid into a 31 band HOG "image".
                    Step 3. Scan a linear classifier over each HOG image in the pyramid. 
                  Moreover, the HOG features quantize the input image into a grid of cells,
                  each cell being get_cell_size() by get_cell_size() pixels in size.  So
                  when we scan the object detector over the pyramid we are scanning an
                  appropriately sized window over these smaller quantized HOG features.  In
